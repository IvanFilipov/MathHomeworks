Some code related to mathematical courses:
- Computer Graphics 
- Numerical methods for solving differential equations
- Statistics

@ FMI 2017-2018

The code is written in Octave (GNU free vesrsion of MATLab),
so it should be fully compatibale with MATLab.

Statistics examples are implemented in R.
